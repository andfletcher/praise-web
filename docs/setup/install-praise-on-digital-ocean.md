# How to install Praise on Digital Ocean

## Create a Droplet

When writing this guide we used the following Droplet config:

- Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS) x64
- 80 GB disk
- 4 GB memory

Praise might well run on a smaller setup as well, that is yet to be determined though.

## Configure a hostname

The webserver hosting the Praise dashboard automatically generates https certificates and therefore needs be configured with a hostname. Configure an `A RECORD` at your DNS provider that points to the Droplet IP.

For example, the Commons Stack Praise DNS setup:

| TYPE | DOMAIN NAME             | IP             | TTL    |
| ---- | ----------------------- | -------------- | ------ |
| A    | praise.commonsstack.org | 167.172.63.125 | 30 min |

## Use ssh to access Droplet

```
ssh root@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
```

This guide installs Praise under the root user, making no effort to secure the server. The following steps are optional but highly recommended:

- [Set up a firewall plus a user account with reduced privileges](digital-ocean-initial-setup.md)

## Install Docker
