# What is Praise?

As decentralized organizations grow it is challenging to involve the whole community in determining what contributions to value. Praise invites communities to build a culture of giving and gratitude, reward contributions to the community and involve the community every step of the way.

By using Praise, communities acknowledge the full spectrum of value created - ranging from small to large contributions. Even contributions made outside of any platform can be praised. Praise allows for bottom up value systems to emerge by listening to what the community values.

Praise has been tried and tested in communities such as the Token Engineering Commons, Commons Stack and Giveth.

Praise is similar to a team allocation in other token economies, but done via a unique distributed signal aggregation approach intended to achieve many goals:

- Acknowledge and reward full spectrum contributions
- A clear and transparent process with full community involvement
- Create a culture of giving and gratitude
- Instigate decentralized updates about work being done
- Focus on transparency and data analysis

## Praise is Open Source

Praise is an open source system developed by [Commons Stack](https://commonsstack.org). To learn more about how Praise could be used in your community please reach out to us!

## Commons Stack Services

As an open source product, Praise can be deployed by any community that wishes to use it. The deployment protocols we use are also freely available to guide a community through self-deployment.

However, we also support communities that wish to have Commons Stack manage this process for them. In contracting Commons Stack, you will work with the core team members that have conceived and developed Praise as well as benefit from our experience deploying and managing Praise in multiple communities.

Reach out to us on the [Commons Stack Discord](<(http://discord.link/commonsstack)>) to talk about this option.
