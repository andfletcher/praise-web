# What is Praise?

As decentralized organizations grow it becomes more difficult to involve the whole community in determining what contributions to value. Praise invites communities to build a culture of giving and gratitude, involving contributors at every step of the process.

Praise allows communities to acknowledge the full spectrum of value created - ranging from small to large contributions over a number of platforms. Even contributions made outside of any tech platform can be praised.

The praise process has been tried and tested over a number of months in communities such as the TEC - the Token Engineering Commons, Commons Stack and Giveth. The tools developed along the way have now been turned into the open source project Praise.

Praise is similar to a team allocation in other token economies, but done via a unique distributed signal aggregation approach intended to achieve many goals:

- Acknowledge and reward full spectrum contributions
- A clear and transparent process with full community involvement
- Create a culture of giving and gratitude
- Instigate decentralized updates about work being done
- Focus on transparency and data analysis

## Praise is Open Source
