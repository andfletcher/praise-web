# Writing excellent Praise

When writing Praise, the most important thing to remember is that your praise will be scored by quantifiers. By making the impact of the contribution clear, it will be easier for quantifiers to score. Try to be as descriptive and specific as possible! This will help anyone understand the impact of the contribution you are praising.

## Praise Guidelines

There are two main guidelines to writing excellent Praise.

1. **Be specific!** Name the exact contribution you want to praise.
2. **Express personal** or community impact! Say how the action or contribution has an impact on you or the community.

When a Praise is not specific, the praise receiver will not receive as high a score as they would with more detail. When the impact is vague or missing, the quantifier may not be able to determine exactly how important that contribution actually is. Here are some Praise examples that are not specific enough to quantify easily:

- `/praise @xyz for his new article.` What new article? What was it about? What impact did it have for the community?

- `/praise @xyz for your continuous involvement in the community.` How were they involved? What specifically did they do? What impact did that have for the community?

- `/praise @abc @def @ghi @xyz for their participation in ETHDenver, for their great commitment to the community, leading calls and helping everyone around.`
  There are 4 people being praised for 4 different actions all at once. How can anyone give all of this a single score? It is important to make it clear exactly who is being praised for what.

When a Praise is unrelated to any personal or community impact, they praise receiver will also not receive a high score. Always try to relate the Praise to a personal or community impact.

- `/praise @xyz for being man enough to know how to change a tire.` How is this related to the community? Praise that doesn’t have a clear connection with the community will receive a very low score, or even be dismissed. If you specify how it has helped the community, then the score should be much higher.

## Objective vs. Subjective Praise

Praise can be either objective or subjective.

By objective we mean factual and not influenced by personal feelings or opinions. Here are some examples of objective contributions that could be monitored and rewarded by Praise:

- Basic engagements with the community on twitter or other social media
- Meeting attendance and/or participation

It may be easier to assign a specific value to objective contributions like the ones listed above but it is the subjective Praise that shows peer-to-peer gratitude and impact in the community. This is where the heart of the community can be seen.

By subjective we mean based on or influenced by personal feelings, tastes or opinions. In order to avoid writing subjective Praise that is difficult to accurately quantify, let’s take a look at what they might look like. Below are some examples as well as question prompts to help craft the praise in a way that provides details about the contribution and the impact it made on a personal or community level.
